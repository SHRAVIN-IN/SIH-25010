# **Problem Title**

**SIH 25006:** *Digital Farm Management Portal for Strengthening Biosecurity in Pig and Poultry Farms*

---

# **1. Problem Description**

## **Background**

Biosecurity remains one of the most critical pillars in livestock management, especially in pig and poultry farming, where disease outbreaks like Avian Influenza and African Swine Fever can devastate livelihoods, disrupt market supply chains, and threaten national food security. Despite government initiatives, many farmers—especially those in remote and resource-poor areas—lack access to structured guidelines, real-time disease alerts, and expert support for adopting proper biosecurity protocols.

This gap highlights the urgent need for a digital ecosystem that simplifies biosecurity implementation while supporting continuous learning, monitoring, and compliance.

---

## **Detailed Problem Explanation**

Farmers often face challenges such as:

* Limited knowledge of disease prevention techniques
* Inability to assess their farm’s biosecurity vulnerabilities
* Lack of digitized records for health, feed, vaccination, and waste management
* No easy access to government biosecurity standards
* Limited coordination with veterinary experts
* Absence of localized, real-time outbreak notifications

Hence, a **digital farm biosecurity management system** is necessary to bridge the gap between policy-level guidelines and farm-level execution.

---

# **2. Expected Outcomes**

The platform is expected to deliver:

* Improved awareness of biosecurity norms
* Farm-level self-assessment of risks
* Personalized biosecurity improvement protocols
* Digitized records for compliance and audits
* Instant alerts for nearby disease outbreaks
* Better animal health and enhanced farm productivity
* Stronger coordination among farmers, veterinarians, and authorities
* National-level support for surveillance and data-driven policymaking

# **5. Proposed Solution**

## **Overview**

We propose a **Digital Farm Management & Biosecurity Portal** designed specifically for pig and poultry farmers. This platform integrates learning modules, risk assessment, compliance tracking, and real-time disease alerts, enabling farmers to actively maintain biosecurity standards.

---

## **Key Modules**

### **A. Biosecurity Risk Assessment**

* Step-by-step questionnaire for farmers
* AI-based suggestions to enhance hygiene, movement control, feed handling, and waste management
* Risk scoring dashboard with improvement roadmap

### **B. Training & Awareness Hub**

* Short videos, illustrations, and vernacular content
* Interactive learning quizzes
* Certificates upon completion to motivate participation

### **C. Digital Record & Compliance Management**

* Vaccination and medication logbook
* Feed and inventory records
* Automatic biosecurity compliance reports as per national standards

### **D. Disease Alerts & Monitoring System**

* Real-time notifications based on GPS and gov-official disease APIs
* Alerts for potential biosecurity breaches
* Heat maps of high-risk zones

### **E. Farmer Networking & Support**

* Discussion forum for farmers, veterinary specialists, and field workers
* Information on government schemes and subsidies
* Integrated helpdesk and chatbot support

### **F. Data Analytics Dashboard (for authorities)**

* Visualizations of farm data
* Trend analysis for disease surveillance
* Region-wise biosecurity compliance metrics

---

# **6. How the Solution Addresses the Problem**

* Makes biosecurity simple, interactive, and accessible
* Reduces outbreak risk by enabling farmers to prevent issues before they arise
* Provides authorities with structured data for better decision-making
* Strengthens farmer–veterinarian collaboration
* Bridges the knowledge and access gap for small and marginal farmers

---

# **7. Innovation & Uniqueness**

* AI-driven risk assessment customized per farm
* Multilingual mobile-first design suitable for low-connectivity regions
* Gamified learning modules to increase farmer engagement
* Optional integration with IoT sensors (temperature, water quality, animal movement)
* GIS-based real-time outbreak alerting system
* One combined portal for training, assessment, compliance, alerts, and reporting — **a first-of-its-kind ecosystem**
